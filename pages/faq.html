          <h4 id="q1">Why is this website so ugly?</h4>
          I'm making this website, super simple and from scratch.<br />
          I got tired of looking for the 'perfect' theme.<br />
          Decided to keep is simple and just use vanilla html/css as much as
          possible. It would be great if I didnt have to use any javascript
          either.<br />
          I really liked Paul Graham's website (http://www.paulgraham.com/) so I
          decided to make something similar.<br />
          <br />
          This whole website is 37Kb. Old school geeks and nerds will appreciate
          this.<br />
          This is because there are 701 characters on this website and each
          character takes up 1 byte.<br />

          <h4 id="q2">Why am I making such a small website?</h4>
          It is because I want to experience what it was like to be a web
          developer before we had such a large about of memory to play with<br /><br />

          I decided to take inspriation from PG's website. Upon analysis, I
          discoverd some eyebrow lifting facts. The sidebar PG has is an image,
          and he manually coded in the coordinates that will lead to the correct
          content. LOL this is a terrible. But I'm guessing there weren't as
          many ways of manipulating the web back in the day.<br /><br />

          <h4 id="q3">Why are there so many spelling and other errors here?</h4>
          For most things I think 20-80 rule is good idea. Get 80% of the
          results from the 20% work put in. The Law of diminishing return is
          something to be aware of and be logical about. So when I am editing or
          adding something to this website, I note it down and don't bother to
          proof read multiple times as long as the communication is present. I
          also have a hard time spelling words.

          <h4 id="q4">What is the purpose of this website?</h4>
          I find that when people have a better understanding of what kind of a
          person you are, communication, ideas and information flows more
          smoothly. So when a stranger comes across my website and learn a bit
          about me they will be able to interact with me in a more meaningful
          way and converstions won't be about the weather but instead will be
          thought provoking discussions. Essentially this is a way for others to
          get to know me better so we can have better interactions.
