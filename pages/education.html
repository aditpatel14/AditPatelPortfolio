          <h4>Early Schooling</h4>
          I did most of my schooling in Toronto. For grades 1-12 I went to
          decent public schools with great extracurricular programs and
          dedicated teachers. Through the various robotics programs I was
          involved in I knew early on(when an engineer came in for a talk in
          grade 8 and mentioned you get a ring) that I wanted to go the
          engineering route.

          <br />
          <h4>University</h4>
          Building things was my calling. I enrolled into Engineering at
          McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario after graduating from
          hichschool. At the end of first year I had to decided a field to
          special in. I wanted the ability to build anything from scratch,
          bottom up and so i needed to enroll in a program that would let me
          touch all aspects of engineering a product, in the end it came down to
          2 options, mechatronics engineering or Software Engineer embedded
          systems design. I looked into the specific courses and the latter
          aligned better with what I wanted to learn. In June 2019 I graduated
          with a B.Eng from McMaster and can call myself an engineer.
          <br />

          <h4>On goinging education</h4>
          You dont stop learning when you leave school. I've completed more
          courses online than I can recall. Would have to trace different
          accounts on different websites like Udemy, Udacity, Stackskills, edX,
          youtube to figure out the whole list. These courses range in all
          fields. When I get really interested in a topic and my curisity has
          been triggered I enjoy putting everything aside and going down the
          rabbit hole until I am satisfied with the answers I find. Oh and
          howstuffworks.com is one of my favourite websites.

          <h4>Reflection on the education systems</h4>
          Currently its a one size fits all scenario and this does not work. I
          began getting frustrated with how school works towards the end of
          highschool when I was forced to take courses I didn't want to over
          courses I had an interest in. The semantics of how students are graded
          and the large variance between schools also leads to frustrations. How
          is it possible that kids are expected to learn without first being
          inspired to learn, a 15 year old kid who has no interest in certain
          things will not learn through osmosis of being at school and this
          unfortunately is the basis of how school works. Who thought that just
          telling kids to go to school will make them want to learn things.
          There are changes that need to be made at a high level of how
          educational instuitions work and also at the lower level of the
          semantics and metrics used. This is just at the conceptual level. Now
          the logistical level, costs and economics education. There is
          absolutly no reason for students to pay the absurd amount in tuition
          and other fees they are forced to pay today. To be continued ...
