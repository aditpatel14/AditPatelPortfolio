          I love working with my hands and building things.

              <b>SAP-1 Computer</b> Building an 8 bit computer from scratch on
              breadboards, was initially thinking of doing it at the transistor
              level but the amount of breadboards I would need was too damn
              high. Super fun project, got to learn about computer architecture
              and was able to see how the computer industry came about<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li class="dot">
              <b>Smartvents</b>
              Wifi connected vents that open/close dynamically to maintain
              different temperature levels in all the rooms of a house.
              Initially made as a prototype for an Idea I was pitching. Ended up
              winning the competition, got funding to bring idea to life. A
              hardware iot project. Idea came about from personal problems -
              disputes with roommates on what the apartment temperature should
              be.

              <b>Mechatronics car for P.Eng Competition</b>
              Got to work with 2 of my best mates. We built an amazing small
              race car. Won Judge's award. I designed the elecrical system from
              scratch, was the first time I had to really think and design a
              circuit from scratch.

              <b>FireFighting Robot</b>
              Built a fire-truck robot that located fire in a maze and put it
              out.

              <b>FIRST Robotics & VEX Robotics 2012-2015</b>
              Built some amazing robots. My favourite seasons were Grade 10 VEX
              and Grade 11 VEX. Will add detail later.

              <b>Woodshop walking humanoid</b>
              Created a robot that walks on 2 legs

              <b>Electro-mechnical Rube Goldbergs</b>
              Rube Goldbergs are fun, been building them since before I knew
              they were called Rube Goldbergs. All my Rube Goldbergs have a high
              presence of lowlevel circuitry, not just mechnical energy
              transfers.
