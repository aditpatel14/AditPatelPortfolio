          <h4 id="q5">Take one on Kickstarter</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Dec 12, 2019</h4>
          In 2nd year my roommate and I used to brain storm business ideas and
          problems we could build solutions for on the daily. Although there
          were many problems we had no idea on how to solve, a few fell through
          the cracks that were doable. One such idea was the Edison box. This
          was just a monthly circuit building kit. We created our first monthly
          kit, corresponding website, and made a video at home, on a home
          budget. And Launched on kickstarter. This was going to get funded in a
          week and get us the initial capital we needed to bulk order parts from
          china! Right? No, helll no, we were rookies who knew nothing about
          getting our project funded. We kept the project up for about 14 days
          before canceling it and got about $250 by getting 10 users to signup
          during the first two days. Once the project was buried as new projects
          came up, no one saw it and it didn’t get funding. It was a good idea
          but our execution was terrible. Who knew marketing was very important.
          Since then I’ve gone on to learn about and have launched successful
          ads on fb, reddit, google and all sorts of social media platforms with
          a high conversion rate. Had I known this prior to our kickstarter we
          would’ve done quite well. This was one of many side hustles I worked
          on during my university days. This was take one on kickstarter, I’m
          certain I will have projects in the future that I could potentially
          launch and get funded through kickstarter.

          <h4 id="q4">On setting and achieving goals</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Dec 1, 2019</h4>
          Sometime after grade 3, I realized there was more to school than just
          going to classes, I started learned about other opportunities in
          school. I loved track and field day. I became more aware of it in
          grade 4 and enjoyed the day, won a few ribbons and decided I wanted to
          win more ribbons next year and place higher. I also wanted to win so I
          could go on this day trip to a different school and compete with
          others, get free lunch and enjoy the day off from actual school. So
          when spring rolled around in 2008 I was in grade 5. I started
          practicing daily, I used to run, I used to practice running long
          jumps, standing long jumps. I was competing with my friends and as a
          result I believe we both got better. We had his older sister tracking
          our results on a clipboard like the actual thing, I even went as far
          as to getting the grid paper form school instead of making grid lines
          with a ruler. Well, track and field day rolled around in grade 5. And
          I had great results. I placed top 3 in five out of the six events, I
          got my first ever 1st place ribbon in triple jump, I placed 2nd in
          running long jump, 2nd in standing long jump and 2nd in the 400 meters
          race losing to the same two guy for every 2nd place ribbon I had(their
          genes were definitely athletes’ genes, but I did beat them in the
          triple jump). Lastly I placed 3rd in 100m dash. During all those years
          I was never able to place in shot-put. I don’t think I got the
          technique right nor did I have the build to push a heavy ball away
          from my body as far as possible. I went on to represent my school at
          the next level of the competition and got that school day trip. The
          following year same situation, I practiced and got ready for the
          events and represented my school at the next level. When I say
          practice, these weren’t just whatever drills, they were timed drills,
          where I used to track my result and compare my progress. Anyways I
          write this is retrospect of how when my vision was much more narrow, I
          used to set a goal, make a plan and execute on it, I was actually able
          to get the results. I write this to remind myself that when there is a
          plan and you put in the time to execute, attaining your goals becomes
          a very doable thing. Over the next couple of years, I would go on to
          set targets to get certain awards and prizes and actually did end up
          getting them, until one day I lost taste for awards and prizes… story
          for another time.

          <h4 id="q3">Partners in class</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Nov 4, 2019</h4>
          I remember the days when teachers used to say, you can pick your
          partners, you’d look at your best friend and they would be looking
          back. what a great time. Its funny for each class I had a different
          partner. For example, in gym I used to be with this one guy, in
          science with another guy. I may have been partnering myself up with
          the best in each case. There would be times when I wasn’t the best in
          class and I generally knew when this was the case, most people know
          when they are and aren't the best at something.

          <h4 id="q2">The story about my first win</h4>
          The first contest I ever won was an art contest. I was in Grade 1, had
          just moved back to India after spending about 9 months in Canada. (My
          parents would later decide Canada is the place to be in order to
          provide better opportunities for my brother and I. We would end up
          shifting back to Toronto in a year’s time). I remember the night
          before the contest I had tactfully decided what I was going to draw,
          the theme was supposed to be around India’s Independence or Republic
          day, I can’t remember which but we were supposed to draw a flag. So
          the night before I quickly sketched how I would draw the flag and
          decided to make it look 3D and draw the flag as if wind was blowing
          through it and focus on small details like lettings the strings fly in
          all directions (result of the wind), add steps to the flag mount, draw
          additional imagery in the background to give it a realistic feel. At
          that point I had no intention in winning the contest, I was just
          trying to make the best drawing I possibly could. The next day at
          school we had an hour to complete our drawing and submit it. I did it,
          enjoyed the hour, and forgot about it. At the end of the day as I am
          heading back to my ride home a lady who worked for the school tracked
          me down told me I had won the art contest and gave me a small gift. I
          took it home, opened it and found a 24 set of oil pastels. I treasured
          those pastel crayons and used them carefully.

          <h4 id="q1">The "school busses" in India</h4>
          When I was a very small boy just starting school in India. I used to
          get rides to and from school like almost every other kid. These school
          busses weren't actual school busses kids so luxuriously enjoy in North
          America. No, the school bus options were either a rickshaw(made for 3
          adults max) or Small white van(made for 6 adults), protrayed in
          hollywood as the stranger van that abducts you. Each of these vehicles
          squeezed as many kids in as possible, what safety concerns? So this is
          what I remember; I was this 4 or 5 year old kid in juinor
          kindergarten. I would wake up get ready for school and mentally
          prepare myself for the terrible shitshow of a ride to school. I was
          the 5th or 6th kid to get picked up so initially there would be some
          room to sit. But as more kids were picked up I got pushed to the
          rightmost side. There were about 10-12 kids picked up everyday in that
          rickshaw. It was so uncomfortable and that is an understatement. To
          make matters worse, my head would be right up againts the metal frame
          on the right side. Each bump or pothole on the road(and there were
          countless) banged my head up againt that frame. Man was that a
          struggle.
