          <h4 id="q2">The story about my first win</h4>
          The first contest I ever won was an art contest. I was in Grade 1, had
          just moved back to India after spending about 9 months in Canada. (My
          parents would later decide Canada is the place to be in order to
          provide better opportunities for my brother and I. We would end up
          shifting back to Toronto in a year’s time). I remember the night
          before the contest I had tactfully decided what I was going to draw,
          the theme was supposed to be around India’s Independence or Republic
          day, I can’t remember which but we were supposed to draw a flag. So
          the night before I quickly sketched how I would draw the flag and
          decided to make it look 3D and draw the flag as if wind was blowing
          through it and focus on small details like lettings the strings fly in
          all directions (result of the wind), add steps to the flag mount, draw
          additional imagery in the background to give it a realistic feel. At
          that point I had no intention in winning the contest, I was just
          trying to make the best drawing I possibly could. The next day at
          school we had an hour to complete our drawing and submit it. I did it,
          enjoyed the hour, and forgot about it. At the end of the day as I am
          heading back to my ride home a lady who worked for the school tracked
          me down told me I had won the art contest and gave me a small gift. I
          took it home, opened it and found a 24 set of oil pastels. I treasured
          those pastel crayons and used them carefully.

          <h4 id="q1">The "school busses" in India</h4>
          When I was a very small boy just starting school in India. I used to
          get rides to and from school like almost every other kid. These school
          busses weren't actual school busses kids so luxuriously enjoy in North
          America. No, the school bus options were either a rickshaw(made for 3
          adults max) or Small white van(made for 6 adults), protrayed in
          hollywood as the stranger van that abducts you. Each of these vehicles
          squeezed as many kids in as possible, what safety concerns? So this is
          what I remember; I was this 4 or 5 year old kid in juinor
          kindergarten. I would wake up get ready for school and mentally
          prepare myself for the terrible shitshow of a ride to school. I was
          the 5th or 6th kid to get picked up so initially there would be some
          room to sit. But as more kids were picked up I got pushed to the
          rightmost side. There were about 10-12 kids picked up everyday in that
          rickshaw. It was so uncomfortable and that is an understatement. To
          make matters worse, my head would be right up againts the metal frame
          on the right side. Each bump or pothole on the road(and there were
          countless) banged my head up againt that frame. Man was that a
          struggle.
