          <h4>
            The coming end of laborous tasks
          </h4>
          Any Laborious process that has way too much paper work involved will 
          be dome on mobile apps or online in the future. Even large things like buying homes and cars.

          <h4>
            Should've paid more attention in class...
          </h4>
          Sometimes it's very hard to realize the value of something beforehand
          and only really understand why it was valuable in retrospect. I am
          diving deep into certain engineering topics only to realize my profs
          had covered this is class but I was not paying attention or did not
          bother attending. At the time I thought certain courses were useless,
          looking back I wish I had been more proactive and learned about why
          they could potentially be useful in the future. As a result I am now
          going through a fat elec text book to find what I need.

          <h4>The Dream Team</h4>
          This is the dream team, individuals who would be great additions to my
          team. Initials present only for privacy. They can probably decode who
          they are.<br />
          VP: Smart, can code, can help lead<br />
          VS: Best coder I know, will get it to work<br />
          MD: Smartest person in eng at uni<br />
          HP: Would grind and deliver<br />
          ZP: Can talk and sell. Overall a good people person<br />
          BS: Biz dev, experienced, done many side hustle/ projects together<br />
          MP: Tons of exp working together, will grind<br />
          <br />

          <h4>To those who discourage "jack of all trades"</h4>
          I don't buy the BS that people cannot master more than one specific
          field, ie, jack of all trades master of none. If someone puts in the
          time to master all trades then they will be masters of those trades.
          Even though time to learn different diciplines is zero-summed. Cross
          field exposure will allow the individual to have insights that
          specialized individuals are not capable of, making jack of all trades
          a non zero-sum.

          <!-- <h4>The coming wave of comsumer tech - Sept 19, 2019</h4> -->
          I envy the students of tomorrow. Within the next 10 years much like
          how computers changed school, a new gadget will do the same thing.
          Holographic Augmeted Reality will simply make learning so much more
          interactive and intuitive. Imagine not having to visualize functions
          or graphing them on paper like what I had to do, imagine being able to
          see them in 3D. Imagine going to bio class but instead of just
          pictures in a text book you could take apart the innerworkings of a
          cell right in your hands.

          <h4>On how to learn something</h4>
          <!-- <h4>On how to learn something - Sept 12, 2019</h4> -->
          I dont know where I came across this, but years ago I heard the best
          way to understand something is to watch it over and over again until
          the magic goes away, and this was refering to becoming a great actor.
          I like to do the same thing with engineered products, I like striping
          away a complex mechanism bit by bit until I finally understand all the
          underlying principles and it just makes logical sense. This happened
          to me with the computer. I was so amazed at how Steve Wozniak made the
          Apple 1. Then I looked into how it could be done, and kept inching
          away until all that was left were logical step. Now the invention
          although amazing doesent seem like a magical illusion, I can trace how
          he came up with the idea and we go to where we are today. Its amazing.
          I intend to apply this to all things that intrigue me throughout
          life.<br /><br />
