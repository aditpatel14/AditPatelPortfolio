          <h4>Reflections and Short Bursts of Thoughts</h4>


          <h4 id='e8'>Government first approach to innovation</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Jan 20, 2020</h4>
          Countries and whole industries would benefit greatly if governments paved 
          way for innovation rather than second guessing and being skeptical about 
          new tech. Example of actions that different levels of the government could
           take which would result in rapid adoption of new tech:
          <br>
          <br>
          Governments should enforce schools to go online. I wondered for years why we 
          had to sign the same documents for doing any activity at school or going on 
          any school trip. The amount of paper wasted here is unbelievable. Well I eventually 
          found out why, it’s a dumb enforcement required by school unions. This may have 
          made sense a couple of decades ago but why is it still in place today? Something 
          like an app for teacher - parent communication would work A BILLION times better 
          than using children as messenger and paper as the medium of communication. Not only 
          this but things like report cards should be online as well. It’s surprising that 
          the only records I have of my education from my high school are physical paper records.
           My guess is enabling a higher rate of communication will allow parents to be better 
           involved in their child’s education.
          <br>
          <br>
          Governments should ask health clinics and doctors to go online. The communication 
          between a doctor and a patient should be readily available whenever either party 
          desires. I can go back and see what conversation I had with my friends four years 
          ago on Facebook. But I don’t have a records of my doctor’s visits and what we talked
           about during those visits. Tracking a patient’s information may eventually lead to 
           the recognition of a trend that could potentially save the individual. There are some 
           health clinics that have an online portal for their patients should they choose to 
           opt in, I’ve tried these and it is an amazing experience for a user to have.
            Governments need to step in and help accelerate this process.
          <br>
          <br>
          Governments need to step in and help accelerate the autonomous transportation industry. 
          This is an inevitable change that’s coming. Governments should help accelerate it because
           it will pay them dividends. Imagine if municipalities marked streets to allow cars to better
            recognize curbs, lanes and other things. A standardization around the world would be great
             and definitely help train existing autonomous cars be better at identifying it’s surroundings.

          <h4 id="q6">The impeding doom of laborous tasks </h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Dec 17, 2019</h4>
          Any laborious process that has way too much paper work involved will 
          be done on mobile apps or online in the future. Even large things like buying homes and cars.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />





          <h4 id="q5">Should've paid more attention in class...</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Dec 17,2019</h4>
          Sometimes it's very hard to realize the value of something beforehand
          and only really understand why it was valuable in retrospect. I am
          diving deep into certain engineering topics only to realize my profs
          had covered this is class but I was not paying attention or did not
          bother attending. At the time I thought certain courses were useless,
          looking back I wish I had been more proactive and learned about why
          they could potentially be useful in the future. As a result I am now
          going through a fat elec text book to find what I need.

          <h4 id="q4">The Dream Team</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Sep 23, 2019</h4>
          This is the dream team, individuals who would be great additions to my
          team. Initials present only for privacy. They can probably decode who
          they are.<br />
          VP: Smart, can code, can help lead<br />
          VS: Best coder I know, will get it to work<br />
          MD: Smartest person in eng at uni<br />
          HP: Would grind and deliver<br />
          ZP: Can talk and sell. Overall a people person<br />
          BS: Biz dev, experienced, done many side hustle/ projects together<br />
          MP: Tons of exp working together, will grind
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4 id="q3">To those who discourage "jack of all trades"</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Sep 19, 2019</h4>
          I don't buy the BS that people cannot master more than one specific
          field, ie, jack of all trades master of none. If someone puts in the
          time to master all trades then they will be masters of those trades.
          Even though time to learn different diciplines is zero-summed. Cross
          field exposure will allow the individual to have insights that
          specialized individuals are not capable of, making jack of all trades
          a non zero-sum.

          <h4 id="q2">The coming wave of comsumer tech </h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Sep 19, 2019</h4>
          <!-- <h4>The coming wave of comsumer tech - Sept 19, 2019</h4> -->
          I envy the students of tomorrow. Within the next 10 years much like
          how computers changed school, a new gadget will do the same thing.
          Holographic Augmeted Reality will simply make learning so much more
          interactive and intuitive. Imagine not having to visualize functions
          or graphing them on paper like what I had to do, imagine being able to
          see them in 3D. Imagine going to bio class but instead of just
          pictures in a text book you could take apart the innerworkings of a
          cell right in your hands.

          <h4 id="q1">On how to learn something</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Sep 12, 2019</h4>
          <!-- <h4>On how to learn something - Sept 12, 2019</h4> -->
          I dont know where I came across this, but years ago I heard the best
          way to understand something is to watch it over and over again until
          the magic goes away, and this was refering to becoming a great actor.
          I like to do the same thing with engineered products, I like striping
          away a complex mechanism bit by bit until I finally understand all the
          underlying principles and it just makes logical sense. This happened
          to me with the computer. I was so amazed at how Steve Wozniak made the
          Apple 1. Then I looked into how it could be done, and kept inching
          away until all that was left were logical step. Now the invention
          although amazing doesent seem like a magical illusion, I can trace how
          he came up with the idea and we go to where we are today. Its amazing.
          I intend to apply this to all things that intrigue me throughout
          life.
