          <h4 id="e12">On 28</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Feb 14, 2025</h4>
          I Feel calm at 28. Also Idk why I stopped adding notes here. Think
          some fear of judgement, but idk, i honestly dont remember.

          <h4 id="e12">On home intrusive devices</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Mar 17, 2020</h4>
          Smart devices like Google home, alexa, Facebook portal should come
          with detachable cameras and speakers. This will help capture the
          market of people who are skeptical about being monitored all the time.
          They can just detatch the mics and cameras

          <h4 id="e11">Self-governing software</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Jan 27, 2020</h4>
          I can’t wait until we have self governing software services in place.
          Think the amazon marketplace without the corporate entity or Uber’s
          taxi service without the Uber corporate entity. There is no real
          reason why such a software can’t operate on its own. We currently have
          something semi-self governing, bitcoin. I am pretty sure we will get
          to a state where software services will be self governing and there
          will be no need for the middle men companies.

          <h4 class="entry">Jan 26, 2020</h4>
          I want my life’s work to be very impactful. It is very easy today to
          get caught up working on a triviality that someone is willing to pay
          you for. I think the most significant leaps forward for mankind have
          been made by individuals when they proactively thought about their
          life’s work. I want my life’s work to be in one of these categories;
          <ul>
            <li class="dot">
              Climate change and Energy - the problem of getting humans to a
              sustainable energy consumption level and finding ways to push
              green energy production forward. It is sicken to the core how
              humans show the same symptoms for the Earth that a virus would on
              an invading cell.

              Education - Education for all is the best, safest and high
              dividend bet we can make today. Money, geography or anything else
              should not be a reason why a child does not get the best possible
              education. I think there is a way to marry the internet with a new
              educational system that has yet to be found (online courses aren’t
              the answer, they probably are a piece of the puzzle though).

              Flying Cars or personal flying units, this is just the pursuit of
              something cool and a personal dream of mine. I would love to be
              able to hop into a thing and go flying like I’m going on a drive
              or a bike ride. I read stories about people a few decade back
              having small personal planes and taking them for a ride. I’m so
              fascinated by how Sam Walton used to just hop into his plane and
              go scouting for new location or use the planes to go between
              different cities to check up on other Walmart locations.

              Artificial Intelligence and humanoids - in 2009 when I first saw
              the movie iRobot I would say there’s no way the future will look
              like this in 2035, but today I think its possible that we may have
              smart or smart-enough humanoids walking amongst us within the next
              two decades. Building robots is something I love to do.

              Lastly, if I find a new consumer product that has the potential to
              completely change how the world around us operates I would hop in
              and work on that, so this would be the personal computer industry
              in the late 70s and the iPhone in 2000s. The next wave might be a
              different avatar of personal computing, probably something in
              Augmented Reality.

          <h4 id="e8">Government first approach to innovation</h4>
          <h4 class="entry">Jan 20, 2020</h4>
          Countries and whole industries would benefit greatly if governments
          paved way for innovation rather than second guessing and being
          skeptical about new tech. Example of actions that different levels of
          the government could take which would result in rapid adoption of new
          tech:
          <br />
          <br />
          Governments should enforce schools to go online. I wondered for years
          why we had to sign the same documents for doing any activity at school
          or going on any school trip. The amount of paper wasted here is
          unbelievable. Well I eventually found out why, it’s a dumb enforcement
          required by school unions. This may have made sense a couple of
          decades ago but why is it still in place today? Something like an app
          for teacher - parent communication would work A BILLION times better
          than using children as messenger and paper as the medium of
          communication. Not only this but things like report cards should be
          online as well. It’s surprising that the only records I have of my
          education from my high school are physical paper records. My guess is
          enabling a higher rate of communication will allow parents to be
          better involved in their child’s education.
          <br />
          <br />
          Governments should ask health clinics and doctors to go online. The
          communication between a doctor and a patient should be readily
          available whenever either party desires. I can go back and see what
          conversation I had with my friends four years ago on Facebook. But I
          don’t have a records of my doctor’s visits and what we talked about
          during those visits. Tracking a patient’s information may eventually
          lead to the recognition of a trend that could potentially save the
          individual. There are some health clinics that have an online portal
          for their patients should they choose to opt in, I’ve tried these and
          it is an amazing experience for a user to have. Governments need to
          step in and help accelerate this process.
          <br />
          <br />
          Governments need to step in and help accelerate the autonomous
          transportation industry. This is an inevitable change that’s coming.
          Governments should help accelerate it because it will pay them
          dividends. Imagine if municipalities marked streets to allow cars to
          better recognize curbs, lanes and other things. A standardization
          around the world would be great and definitely help train existing
          autonomous cars be better at identifying it’s surroundings.

          Sometimes it's very hard to realize the value of something beforehand
          and only really understand why it was valuable in retrospect. I am
          diving deep into certain engineering topics only to realize my profs
          had covered this is class but I was not paying attention or did not
          bother attending. At the time I thought certain courses were useless,
          looking back I wish I had been more proactive and learned about why
          they could potentially be useful in the future. As a result I am now
          going through a fat elec text book to find what I need.

          I don't buy the BS that people cannot master more than one specific
          field, ie, jack of all trades master of none. If someone puts in the
          time to master all trades then they will be masters of those trades.
          Even though time to learn different diciplines is zero-summed. Cross
          field exposure will allow the individual to have insights that
          specialized individuals are not capable of, making jack of all trades
          a non zero-sum.

          I envy the students of tomorrow. Within the next 10 years much like
          how computers changed school, a new gadget will do the same thing.
          Holographic Augmeted Reality will simply make learning so much more
          interactive and intuitive. Imagine not having to visualize functions
          or graphing them on paper like what I had to do, imagine being able to
          see them in 3D. Imagine going to bio class but instead of just
          pictures in a text book you could take apart the innerworkings of a
          cell right in your hands.

          <!-- <h4>On how to learn something - Sept 12, 2019</h4> -->
          I dont know where I came across this, but years ago I heard the best
          way to understand something is to watch it over and over again until
          the magic goes away, and this was refering to becoming a great actor.
          I like to do the same thing with engineered products, I like striping
          away a complex mechanism bit by bit until I finally understand all the
          underlying principles and it just makes logical sense. This happened
          to me with the computer. I was so amazed at how Steve Wozniak made the
          Apple 1. Then I looked into how it could be done, and kept inching
          away until all that was left were logical step. Now the invention
          although amazing doesent seem like a magical illusion, I can trace how
          he came up with the idea and we go to where we are today. Its amazing.
          I intend to apply this to all things that intrigue me throughout life.
