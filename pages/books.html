                stock super fast creates value for anyone, its arbitrage in the
                simplest form. Does it help anyone, except make the individuals
                with an edge in tech get richer, does it create actual value for
                comapny or stakeholder? dosent seem like that. Kudos to Nav for
                making best of the situtaion, raw talent of sorts.
